tests/README

  1.  Summary

  The global test target, i.e. "make test", should be executed prior to
  requesting code review and prior to integration.  That target invokes
  both the unit tests embedded in a subset of the modules and the
  tests/cli-complete.ksh script.  The remainder of tests/ is a
  miscellany of ksh scripts that do various small dependency scenarios.

  cli-complete.ksh is a script that exercises each of the command line
  options of pkg(1) and pkgsend(1), using a variety of dependency
  scenarios.  

  2.  Pending work.

  The embedded tests from the various modules should become disembedded
  and coded to use the Python unittest testing framework module.

  The special dependency scenarios should be recoded as part of
  cli-compelete.ksh

  Targets to evaluate code coverage [1,2] should be added, possibly with
  supporting global options added to each utility.
