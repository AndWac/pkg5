NAME
     pkgfmt - format a package manifest

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgfmt [-c|-d|-u] [package-manifest-file]


DESCRIPTION

     pkgfmt without the -c option will format a package
     manifest in a consistent manner, wrapping lines at
     80 characters, sorting actions by type, placing key
     attributes first, etc.  pkgfmt tries to be robust
     in the case of lines that don't parse into actions;
     such lines will not appear in sorted order.

     If no arguments are given, pkgfmt will read the stdin
     until EOF, and then write the formatted manifest on the
     stdout.  Any manifests specified on the command line
     are formatted in place.

     pkgfmt with the -c option will check to make sure the
     manifest(s) are formatted in pkgfmt style; the -d option
     will display those differences if the file is not properly
     formatted.

OPTIONS

     -c   Check if the manifest is formatted in the pkgfmt style.

     -d   Display differences with respect to formatted version in
          unified form.

     -u   Do not wrap lines at 80 characters; this is useful for
          applying traditional text processing tools to package
          manifests.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Normal execution

     1     The -c or -d options were specified, and one or more
           manifests are not in pkgfmt-normal form.

     99    An unanticipated exception occurred
