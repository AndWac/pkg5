NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/

     pm-updatemanager needs to be invoked with enough privilege to operate
     on an image you do not own. You will normally invoke pm-updatemanager
     using pexec.
