NAME
     pkgdepend - image packaging system dependency analyzer

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgdepend [options] command [cmd_options] [operands]

     /usr/bin/pkgdepend generate [-IMm] -d dir [...] [-D name=value]
         [-k path] manifest_path

     /usr/bin/pkgdepend resolve [-dmosSv] manifest_path ...

DESCRIPTION
     pkgdepend(1) is used to generate and resolve dependencies for
     packages.  A package may depend upon files from other packages.
     pkgdepend(1) is typically used in two passes:  file dependency
     generation and file-to-package resolution.

     The generate subcommand examines a package's content and discovers
     what external files the package needs.

     The resolve subcommand takes the list of files from the generate
     step, and figures out the name of the packages, limited to some
     reference set of packages, that contain the dependent files.
     Currently, the reference set of packages is defined as the packages
     currently installed on the publisher's system.

     Several aspects of delivered files are used as sources of
     dependency information:

     ELF             ELF headers in delivered files are analyzed for
                     dependency information, with the -k and -D options
                     modifying the information obtained.  For more
                     details on ELF dependencies, please see ldd(1)
                     and the Solaris Linker and Libraries Guide.

     Scripts         Shell scripts that contain '#!' lines referencing
                     an interpreter will result in a dependency on the
                     package that delivers that interpreter.

     Python          Python scripts are first analyzed as scripts.  In
                     addition, any imports the script declares may also
                     serve as sources of dependency information.

     Hard links      Hard links in manifests will result in a
                     dependency on the package that delivers the link
                     target.

     SMF             SMF service manifests delivered that include
                     "require_all" dependencies will result in
                     dependencies on the packages that deliver the SMF
                     manifests that provide those FMRIs.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -R dir
          Operate on the image rooted at dir, rather than the one discovered
          automatically.  By default, pkgdepend(1) attempts to determine,
          based on its working directory, in what image it has been invoked.
          If no image metadata can be found in the parent directories, the
          invocation will fail.  See also ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

     --help or -?
          Displays a usage message.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     generate [-IMm] -d dir [-d dir] [-D name=value] [-k path] manifest_path
          Produce the dependencies on files of the manifest specified by
          manifest_path.

          With -I, the dependencies which are satisfied within the
          manifest given will be shown.

          With -M, a list of those file types which could not be
          analyzed will be displayed.

          With -m, the original manifest will be repeated with any
          discovered dependencies added after.

          With -d, add the directory provided to a list of directories
          to search for the manifest's files.

          For each -D, add the 'value' as a way to expand the token
          'name' in run paths for elf file dependencies.

          For each -k, add the path given to the list of run paths
          declared in which to look for kernel modules.  Using the -k
          argument removes the default paths which are /kernel and
          /usr/kernel.

          Run paths, such as those specified by the -k option, can also
          be specified on per-action or per-manifest basis using the
          action or manifest attribute "pkg.depend.runpath" with a
          single value set to a colon-separated string of the paths
          that should be used.

          The use of -k is overridden by any pkg.depend.runpath
          attributes set in the manifest or action.

          The special token "$PKGDEPEND_RUNPATH" can be used as one
          component of the pkg.depend.runpath attribute value in order
          to include the standard system run path for the file
          being analyzed.

          In some cases, it may be necessary to prevent automatic
          generation of dependencies.  An example where this may be
          needed is if a package delivers a sample Python script that
          imports a set of modules: those modules may not be considered
          to be real dependencies for that package.

          The action or manifest attribute "pkg.depend.bypass-generate"
          can be used to indicate that we should not generate dependencies
          against given files.

          pkg.depend.bypass-generate values are perl5 regular expressions,
          used to match file names.  The regular expressions are implicitly
          anchored at the start and end of the file path,

          eg.
               pkg.depend.bypass-generate=this/that
          matches:
               this/that
          but not:
               something/this/that/the/other

     resolve [-mov] [-d output_dir] [-s suffix] manifest_path ...
          Transform dependencies on files into dependencies on the
          packages which deliver those files.  Dependencies are first
          resolved against the manifests given on the command line and
          then against the packages installed on the system.  By
          default, the dependencies for each manifest are placed in a
          file whose name is determined by appending ".res" to the
          manifest's path.

          With -m, repeat the manifest, with any dependencies produced
          by the generate step removed, before adding the resolved
          dependencies.

          With -o, write the results to standard output.

          With -d, write the resolved dependencies for each manifest
          provided in a separate file in output_dir.  By default, each
          file will have the same basename as the manifest that was the
          source of the dependencies written to that file.

          With -s, for each output file, append the given suffix (a "."
          will be added to the argument if not provided) to the basename
          of the file that was the source of the resolved dependencies.

          With -S, only resolve against the manifests given on the command
          line and not against those installed on the system.

          With -v, include additional package dependency debugging
          metadata.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Generate the dependencies for the manifest written in
     foo, whose content directory is in ./bar/baz and store the results
     in foo.fdeps.

     $ pkgdepend generate foo ./bar/baz > foo.fdeps

     Example 2: Resolve the file dependencies in foo.fdeps, and
     bar.fdeps against each other, and the packages currently installed
     on the system.

     $ pkgdepend resolve foo.fdeps bar.fdeps
     $ ls *.res foo.fdeps.res bar.fdeps.res

     Example 3: Generate the file dependencies for two manifests (foo
     and bar) and retain all the information in the original manifests.
     Then resolve the file dependencies and place the resulting
     manifests, which could be used with pkgsend publish, in ./res

     $ pkgdepend generate -m foo > ./deps/foo
     $ pkgdepend generate -m bar > ./deps/bar
     $ pkgdepend resolve -m -d ./res ./deps/foo ./deps/bar
     $ ls ./res foo     bar

     Example 4: Replace all $PLATFORM tokens in the run paths in elf
     files with sun4v and sun4u while generating the dependencies for the
     manifest written in foo whose content directory is in /.

     $ pkgdepend generate -D 'PLATFORM=sun4v' -D 'PLATFORM=sun4u' foo /

     Example 5: Use /kmod as the directory in which to find kernel
     modules when generating the dependencies for the manifest written
     in foo whose content directory is in /.

     $ pkgdepend generate -k /kmod foo /

     Example 6: Append opt/python to the standard Python run path for a given
     python script, and bypass dependency generation against all Python
     modules called "test" for a file delivered as opt/python/foo/file.py.

     We also avoid generating dependencies against any file delivered in
     usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages/xdg.

     $ cat manifest.py
     set name=pkg.fmri value=pkg:/mypackage@1.0,1.0
     set name=pkg.summary value="My test package"
     dir path=opt mode=0755 group=sys owner=root
     dir path=opt/python mode=0755 group=sys owner=root
     dir path=opt/python/foo mode=0755 group=sys owner=root
     file NOHASH path=opt/python/__init__.py mode=0644 group=sys owner=root
     file NOHASH path=opt/python/foo/__init__.py mode=0644 group=sys owner=root
     #
     # We add runpath and bypass-generate attributes below:
     #
     file NOHASH path=opt/python/foo/file.py mode=0644 group=sys owner=root \
         pkg.depend.bypass-generate=^.*/test.py.*$ \
         pkg.depend.bypass-generate=^.*/testmodule.so$ \
         pkg.depend.bypass-generate=^.*/test.so$ \
         pkg.depend.bypass-generate=^usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages/xdg/.*$ \
         pkg.depend.runpath=$PKGDEPEND_RUNPATH:/opt/python

     $ pkgdepend generate -d proto manifest.py
