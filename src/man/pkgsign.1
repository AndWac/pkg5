.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgsign\fR updates the manifest for the given FMRIs in place in the repository by adding a signature action using the provided key and certificates. The modified package retains the original timestamp.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.LP
With \fB-a\fR, use the signature algorithm \fIhash_algorithm\fR instead of the default. The default signature algorithm is \fBrsa-sha256\fR. Supported signature algorithms are \fBrsa-sha256\fR, \fBrsa-sha384\fR, \fBrsa-sha512\fR, \fBsha256\fR, \fBsha384\fR, and \fBsha512\fR. A signature algorithm that only specifies a hash algorithm causes the signature value to be the hash of the manifest of the package. A signature algorithm that specifies \fBrsa\fR and a hash algorithm causes the signature value to be the hash of the manifest signed with the private key provided (see the \fB-c\fR and \fB-k\fR options).
.sp
.LP
With \fB-c\fR, add the certificate \fIpath_to_signing_certificate\fR as the certificate to use when verifying the value of the signature in the action. The \fB-c\fR option can only be used with the \fB-k\fR option.
.sp
.LP
With \fB-i\fR, add the certificate \fIpath_to_intermediate_cert\fR as a certificate to use when validating the certificate \fIpath_to_signing_certificate\fR given as an argument to \fB-c\fR. Multiple certificates can be provided by specifying \fB-i\fR multiple times.
.sp
.LP
With \fB-k\fR, use the private key stored in \fIpath_to_private_key\fR to sign the manifest. The \fB-k\fR option can only be used with the \fB-c\fR option. If \fB-k\fR is not set, then the signature value is the hash of the manifest.
.sp
.LP
With \fB-n\fR, perform a trial run that does not change the repository in any way.
.sp
.LP
With \fB-s\fR, sign packages in the repository at \fIpath_or_uri\fR.
.sp
.LP
With \fB--help\fR, display a usage message.
.sp
.LP
With \fB--no-index\fR, do not update the repository search indices after the signed manifest has been republished.
.sp
.LP
With \fB--no-catalog\fR, do not update the repository catalog after the signed manifest has been republished.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSign Using the Hash Value of the Manifest
.sp
.LP
Sign a package published to \fBhttp://localhost:10000\fR using the hash value of the manifest. This is often useful for testing.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkgsign -s http://localhost:10000 -a sha256 \e\fR
\fBexample_pkg@1.0,5.11-0:20100626T030108Z\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRSign Using a Key and Certificate
.sp
.LP
Sign a package published into the file repository in \fB/foo/bar\fR  using \fBrsa-sha384\fR to hash and sign the manifest. The signature key is in \fB/key/usr2.key\fR, its associated certificate is in \fB/key/usr2.cert\fR, and a certificate needed to validate the certificate is in \fB/icerts/usr1.cert\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkgsign -s file:///foo/bar/ -a rsa-sha384 \e\fR
\fB-k /key/usr2.key -c /key/usr2.cert -i /icerts/usr1.cert \e\fR
