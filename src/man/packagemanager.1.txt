NAME
     packagemanager - GUI for the Image Packaging System

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/packagemanager [options]

     /usr/bin/packagemanager [-hiRU] [--help] [--info-install file]
         [--update-all] [--image-dir dir]
     /usr/bin/packagemanager [file]

DESCRIPTION
     packagemanager(1) is the graphical user interface for pkg(5), the
     Image Packaging System software.

     The Package Manager enables you to perform the following tasks:

     - Search, install and remove packages.

     - Add,  remove and modify publishers.

     - Create, remove and manage boot environments.

     If file operand is specified and its suffix is .p5i,
     packagemanager(1) will launch in Web Install mode, which will add
     one or more publishers and a number of packages for each publisher.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     --help or -h
          Displays a usage message.

     --info-install or -i file
          Allows you to specify a .p5i file to run packagemanager(1) in
          Web Install mode. The file which is specified must have suffix
          .p5i.

     ---image-dir or -R dir
          Operate on the image rooted at dir, rather than the one discovered
          automatically.

     ---update-all or -U
          Update all packages. When the user chooses Updates option in
          packagemanager(1) and the packages containing the pkg(1) or
          packagemanager(1) clients need to be updated before an image
          update can be successfully performed, packagemanager(1) is
          called with this option after the packages have been updated.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Invoke packagemanager(1) on the current image.

     $ packagemanager

     Example 2:  Invoke packagemanager(1) in image stored at /aux0/example_root.

     $ packagemanager -R /aux0/example_root

     Example 3:  Invoke packagemanager(1) in Web Install mode.

     $ packagemanager ~/test.p5i

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Everything worked.

     1     Something bad happened.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

FILES
     Since pkg(5) images can be located arbitrarily within a larger file
     system, we use the token $IMAGE_ROOT to distinguish relative paths.
     For a typical system installation, $IMAGE_ROOT is equivalent to
     "/".

     $IMAGE_ROOT/var/pkg        Metadata directory for a full or partial
                                image.

     $IMAGE_ROOT/.org.opensolaris,pkg
                                Metadata directory for a user image.

     Within a particular image's metadata, certain files and directories
     can contain information useful during repair and recovery.  We use
     the token $IMAGE_META to refer to the top-level directory
     containing the metadata.  $IMAGE_META is typically one of the two
     paths given above.

     $IMAGE_META/gui-cache      Location for cached metadata maintained
                                by packagemanager(1) to speed up program
                                start-up and switching between
                                publishers.

     Other paths within the $IMAGE_META directory hierarchy are Private,
     and are subject to change.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+pkg/

     packagemanager(1) needs to be invoked with sufficient privilege to
     operate on an image's files and directories.  Typically,
     packagemanager(1) is invoked using gksu(1) as follows:

     $ gksu dbus-launch /usr/bin/packagemanager
