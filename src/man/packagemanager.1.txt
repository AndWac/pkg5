NAME
     packagemanager - GUI for the Image Packaging System 

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/packagemanager [options]

     /usr/bin/packagemanager [-hiRU] [--help] [--info-install file]
         [--update-all] [--image-dir dir]
     /usr/bin/packagemanager [file]

DESCRIPTION
     packagemanager is the graphical user interface for the Image Packaging
     System (IPS) software.

     The Package Manager enables you to perform the following tasks:

     - Search, install and remove packages.

     - Add,  remove and modify publishers.

     - Create, remove and manage boot environments.

     If file operand is specified and its suffix is .p5i, packagemanager
     will launch in Web Install mode, which will add one or more publishers
     and a number of packages for each publisher.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     --help or -h
          Displays a usage message.

     --info-install or -i file
          Allows you to specify a .p5i file to run packagemanager in
          Web Install mode. The file which is specified must have suffix .p5i.

     ---image-dir or -R dir
          Operate on the image rooted at dir, rather than the one discovered
          automatically.

     ---update-all or -U
          Update all packages. When the user chooses Updates option in 
          packagemanager and the packages containing pkg or packagemanager
          need to be updated before doing image update, packagemanager is
          called with this option after the packages have been updated.


EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Invoke packagemanager on the current image.

     $ packagemanager

     Example 2:  Invoke packagemanager in image stored at /aux0/example_root.

     $ packagemanager -R /aux0/example_root 

     Example 3:  Invoke packagemanager in Web Install mode.

     $ packagemanager ~/test.p5i

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Everything worked.

     1     Something bad happened.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

FILES
     /var/pkg/gui-cache         Location for cached package data maintained
                                by packagemanager to speed up program 
                                start-up and switching between publishers.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/

     packagemanager needs to be invoked with enough privilege to operate
     on an image you do not own. You will normally invoke packagemanager
     using pexec.
