DESCRIPTION
     pkgrepo provides the ability to create and manage pkg(5) package
     repositories.  Package repositories are a pre-defined set of
     directories and files that permit the storage and retrieval of
     package data by pkg(1) and publication clients such as pkgsend(1)
     or pkgrecv(1).  In addition, when network-based access to a
     package repository is needed, pkg.depotd(1m) can provide clients
     access to the repository to store and/or retrieve package data.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     --help or -?
          Displays a usage message.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     create [--version] <uri_or_path>
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Creates a pkg(5) repository at the specified location.

          With --version, create a repository in a format compatible
          with the specified version.  By default, version 4
          repositories are created.  Supported versions are:

               3    Supports storage of packages for a single
                    publisher, catalog version 1, and search
                    version 1.

               4    Supports storage of packages for multiple
                    publishers, catalog version 1, and search
                    version 1.

     add-signing-ca-certs [-p publisher ...]
       [-s repo_uri_or_path] path ...
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Add the certificates provided as approved CA certificates.

          With -p, only add certificate data for the given publisher.
          The special value 'all' may be used to add the certificate
          data for all publishers.  If not specified, the default
          publisher will be used.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     add-signing-intermediate-certs [-p publisher ...]
       [-s repo_uri_or_path] path ...
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Add the certificates provided as intermediate certificates.

          With -p, only add certificate data for the given publisher.
          The special value 'all' may be used to add the certificate
          data for all publishers.  If not specified, the default
          publisher will be used.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     get [-F format] [-H] [-p publisher ...] [-s repo_uri_or_path]
       [section/property ...]
          Displays the property information for the repository or
          its publishers.

          By default, each property and its value are printed on
          separate lines.  Empty ASCII string values are represented
          by a  pair of double  quotes ("").  Bourne  shell  meta-
          characters (';', '&', '(', ')', '|', '^', '<', '>', newline,
          space, tab, backslash, '"', single-quote, '`') in ASCII
          string values are quoted by backslashes (\).

          With -F, specify an alternative output format.  Currently,
          only 'tsv' (Tab Separated Values) is valid.

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

          With -p, display the property information for the given
          publisher.  The special value 'all' can be used to display
          the properties for all publishers.  This option may be
          specified multiple times.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     info [-F format] [-H] [-p publisher ...] [-s repo_uri_or_path]
          Displays a listing of the package publishers known by the
          repository.  The listing includes the number of packages
          for each publisher, when the publisher's package data was
          last updated, and the status of the publisher's package
          data (such as whether it is currently being processed).

          With -F, specify an alternative output format.  Currently,
          only 'tsv' (Tab Separated Values) is valid.

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

          With -p, only display the data for the given publisher.
          If not provided, the data for all publishers will be
          displayed.  This option may be specified multiple times.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     rebuild [-p publisher ...] [-s repo_uri_or_path] [--no-catalog]
       [--no-index]
          Discards all catalog, search, and other cached information
          found in the repository and then re-creates it based on the
          current contents of the repository.

          With -p, perform the operation only for the given publisher.
          If not provided, or if the special value 'all' is specified,
          the operation will be performed for all publishers.  This
          option may be specified multiple times.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

          With --no-catalog, don't rebuild package data.

          With --no-index, don't rebuild search indexes.

     refresh [-p publisher ...] [-s repo_uri_or_path] [--no-catalog]
       [--no-index]
          Catalogs any new packages found in the repository and
          updates all search indexes.  This is intended for use with
          deferred publication (--no-catalog or --no-index options of
          pkgsend).

          With -p, perform the operation only for the given publisher.
          If not provided, or if the special value 'all' is specified,
          the operation will be performed for all publishers.  This
          option may be specified multiple times.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

          With --no-catalog, don't add any new packages.

          With --no-index, don't update search indexes.

     remove-signing-ca-certs [-p publisher ...]
       [-s repo_uri_or_path] hash ...
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Remove the certificates provided from the list of CA
          certificates.

          With -p, only remove certificate data for the given
          publisher.  The special value 'all' may be used to remove
          the certificate data for all publishers.  If not specified,
          the default publisher will be used.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     remove-signing-intermediate-certs [-p publisher ...]
       [-s repo_uri_or_path] hash ...
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Remove the certificates provided from the list of
          intermediate certificates.

          With -p, only remove certificate data for the given
          publisher.  The special value 'all' may be used to remove
          the certificate data for all publishers.  If not specified,
          the default publisher will be used.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

     set [-p publisher] [-s repo_uri_or_path]
       [section/property=value ...]
          May only be used with filesystem-based repositories.

          Sets the value of the specified properties for the
          repository or publishers.

          With -p, only set property data for the given publisher.
          The special value 'all' may be used to set the property
          for all publishers.

          With -s, operate on the repository located at the given URI
          or filesystem path.

          Properties and values may be specified using one of the
          following forms:

               section/property=
                    The property's value will be cleared.

               section/property=value
                    The property's value will replaced with the given
                    value.

               section/property=(value1 value2 valueN)
                    The property's value will be replaced with the
                    list of values.

     version
          Display a unique string identifying the version of the
          pkg(5) system.  The values produced by the version
          operation are not sortable, or safe for comparison
          beyond equality.
