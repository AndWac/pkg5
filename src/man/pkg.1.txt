DESCRIPTION
     pkg is the retrieval client for the image packaging system.  With a
     valid configuration, pkg can be invoked to create images, target
     locations for packages to be installed, and install packages into
     those images.

     pkg can also uninstall packages, refresh the package catalogs,
     validate package installation in an image and query the image for
     various tokens

     Images can be of three types:  full images, capable of providing a
     complete system; partial images, which are linked to a full image
     (parent image), but do not provide a complete system on their own;
     and user images, which contain only relocatable packages.  (See
     NOTES on user images.)

     pkg(1) attempts to determine, based on its working directory, in
     what image it has been invoked.  If no image metadata can be found
     in the parent directories, the invocation will fail.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     image-create [-FPUz] [-k ssl_key] [-c ssl_cert]
       -a authority=origin_url dir
          Create, at location given by dir, an image suitable for
          package operations.  The default image type is user, as given
          by the -U option.  The image type may be set to a full image
          (-F) or to a partial image (-P) linked to the full image
          enclosing the given dir path.

          A preferred authority must be set using the -a option.  An
          attempt to retrieve the catalog associated with this authority
          will be made following the initial creation operations.

          For authorities using client SSL authentication, a client key
          and client certificate may be registered via the -c and -k
          options.

          If the image is to be run within nonglobal zone context, then
          the -z option can be used to set an appropriate filter.

     image-update [-nv]
          Update all installed packages in the current image to the
          latest available version.  With the -n option, execute the
          requested operation but make no persistent changes to the
          image.  With the -v option, issue verbose progress messages
          during the requested operation.

     refresh
          Retrieve updated catalogs for each authority registered within
          the image.

     install [-nv] pkg_fmri ...
     uninstall [-nrv] pkg_fmri ...
          Install or remove the package specified by pkg_fmri or
          matching pkg_fmri as a substring.  With the -n option, execute
          the requested operation but make no persistent changes to the
          image.  With the -v option, issue verbose progress messages
          during the requested operation.

          In the case of uninstall, the -r option will recursively
          uninstall any packages which are dependent on the initial
          package.

     info [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Display information about packages in a human-readable form.
          Multiple FMRI patterns may be specified; with no patterns,
          display information on all installed packages in the image.

     contents [-Hm] [-o attribute ...] [-s sort_key] [-t action_type ... ]
              [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Display the contents (action attributes) of packages in the
          current image.  By default, only the path attribute is displayed,
          but the attribute set may be determined with the -o option.  The
          -o option may be specified multiple times, or multiple attributes
          may specified as the argument to one -o option by separating the
          attribute names with commas.  Only actions which have the
          requested attributes will be displayed.  The -m option may
          also be used, as a shorthand for '-o action.raw'.

          The -s option specifies the attribute by which the listing should
          be sorted.

          The -t option limits the action types which will be displayed.

          The -H option causes the headers to be omitted.

          With no arguments, the output includes all installed packages.
          Alternatively, multiple FMRI patterns may be specified, which
          restricts the display to the contents of the matching
          packages.

          Several special "pseudo" attribute names are available for
          convenience:

          action.name           Corresponds to the name of the action.
                                For example, for a file action, this is
                                "file"

          action.key            Corresponds to the value of the action's
                                key attribute.  For example, for a file
                                action, this is the path to the file.

          action.raw            Corresponds to the complete contents of
                                the action as represented in the package
                                manifest.  This corresponds to the
                                lines of output of 'pkg contents -m'

          pkg.name              Corresponds to the name of the package
                                containing the action, such as "SUNWcs"

          pkg.shortfmri         Corresponds to the short form FMRI of
                                the package containing the action, such
                                as pkg://opensolaris.org/SUNWzone@0.5.11-0.79

          pkg.authority         Corresponds to the authority of the
                                the package containing the action, such
                                as "opensolaris.org"



     search [-lr] [-s server] token
          Search for the token "token", and display the FMRIs in which the token
          was found.  Which tokens are indexed are action-dependent, but may
          include content hashes and pathnames.

          By default, and with -l, search the image's installed packages.

          With -r, search the servers corresponding to the image's authorities.

          With -s, search the named servers.  This may be specified multiple
          times.

          Both -l and -r (or -s) may be specified together, in which case both
          local and remote searches will be performed.

     list [-aHsuv] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Report on the state of packages in the current image.  With
          -a, report on all packages known, whether installed or not;
          without -a, report only based on installed packages in the
          image.  With -s, display a one-line short-form giving the
          package name and description.  With -u, report only packages
          with newer versions available.  With -v, report full package
          FMRIs.

     verify [-fv] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Validate the installation of packages in the current image.
          With -v, do more verbose reporting. With -f, fully validate the
          contents of files against the hash values in the package
          manifests, as well as checking for file and directory presence.

          The -H option causes the headers to be omitted.

     set-authority [-P] [-k ssl_key] [-c ssl_cert] [-O origin_url] authority
          Update an existing authority or add an additional package
          authority.  With -P, set the specified authority as the
          preferred authority.  With -c and -k, specify client SSL
          certificate and key respectively.  The -O option sets the URL
          prefix for the origin packaging repository for the authority.

     unset-authority authority ...
          Remove the configuration associated with the given authority
          or authorities.

     authority [-H] [authname]
          Display authority information.  With no arguments, display the
          list of configured authorities, and their origin URLs.  If a
          specific authority is requested, display the configuration
          values associated with that authority.  With -H, omit the
          headers from the listing.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Create a new, full image, with authority example.com,
     stored at /aux0/example_root

     $ pkg image-create -F -a example.com=http://pkg.example.com:10000 \
          /aux0/example_root

     Example 2:  Install the latest version of the widget package in the
     current image.

     $ pkg install application/widget

     Example 3:  List the contents of the zfs package.  Display the action
     name, the mode of the file (if defined), the size (if defined), the
     path, and the target (if a link).  Limit the action to types dir,
     file, link, and hardlink, since specifying the :name attribute, which
     is available for all actions, will display a line for all actions,
     which is not desired here.

     $ pkg contents -t dir,file,link,hardlink -o action.name,mode,pkg.size,path,target zfs
     NAME  MODE   SIZE PATH                                TARGET
     dir   0755        etc
     dir   0755        etc/fs
     dir   0755        etc/fs/zfs
     link              etc/fs/zfs/mount                    ../../../sbin/zfs
     link              etc/fs/zfs/umount                   ../../../sbin/zfs
     dir   0755        etc/zfs
     dir   0755        lib
     dir   0755        lib/amd64
     link              lib/amd64/libzfs.so                 libzfs.so.1
     file  0755 469616 lib/amd64/libzfs.so.1
     file  0644  62057 lib/amd64/llib-lzfs.ln
     link              lib/libzfs.so                       libzfs.so.1
     [ ... ]

     Example 4:  Search the package database for the token "bge".

     $ pkg search bge
     basename pkg:/driver/bge/0.5.11,5.11-0.72:20071001T101343Z
     driver_name pkg:/driver/bge/0.5.11,5.11-0.72:20071001T101343Z

     The token shows up both as a basename and as a driver name in the
     package driver/bge.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Everything worked.

     1     Something bad happened.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

FILES
     var/pkg                    Metadata location for full and partial
                                images, relative to image's root
                                directory.

     .org.opensolaris,pkg       Metadata location for user images,
                                relative to image's root directory.

     Metadata is stored in an equivalent tree and format for any image
     type, starting at $META as above.

     $META/catalog              Directory of catalogs from defined
                                authorities.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/

     At present, user images are not restricted to relocatable
     packages--but they will be.

     Although HTTPS servers may validate client SSL certificates, the
     client does not currently validate the server's.
