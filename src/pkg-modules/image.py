        """An Image object is a directory tree containing the laid-down contents
        of a self-consistent graph of Packages.

        An Image has a root path.

        An Image of type IMG_ENTIRE does not have a parent Image.  Other Image
        types must have a parent Image.  The external state of the parent Image
        must be accessible from the Image's context, or duplicated within the
        Image (IMG_PARTIAL for zones, for instance).

        The parent of a user Image can be a partial Image.  The parent of a
        partial Image must be an entire Image.

        An Image of type IMG_USER stores its external state at self.root +
        ".SUNW,pkg".

        An Image of type IMG_ENTIRE or IMG_PARTIAL stores its external state at
        self.root + "/var/pkg".

        XXX Root path probably can't be absolute, so that we can combine or
        multiply-use Image contents."""
