Importing a Solaris build into IPS.
-----------------------------------

% BUILD_IMAGE=/net/netinstall/export/nv/x/72/Solaris_11/Product
% ./clustertoc2import $BUILD_IMAGE/.clustertoc > cluster.import
% cat > my_import
include all.i386
include cluster.import
^D
% ./solaris.py -w $BUILD_IMAGE my_import

The output from solaris.py is large; if new packages appear that
aren't mapped in all.i386, errors about ignoring svr4 packages will
appear.  These need to be resolved before publishing will be successful.

Some more work is needed to make this easier to use and move from 
build to build.

To add only some packages, specify their name after the above command 
as in:

% ./solaris.py -w $BUILD_IMAGE my_import SUNWcsd ...
