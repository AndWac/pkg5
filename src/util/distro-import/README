Importing a Solaris build into IPS.
-----------------------------------

% BUILD_IMAGE=/net/netinstall/export/nv/x/72/Solaris_11/Product
% ./clustertoc2import $BUILD_IMAGE/.clustertoc > cluster.import
% cat > my_import
include all.i386
include cluster.import
^D
% ./solaris.py -w $BUILD_IMAGE my_import

The output from solaris.py is large; if new packages appear that
aren't mapped in all.i386, errors about ignoring svr4 packages will
appear.  These need to be resolved before publishing will be successful.

Some more work is needed to make this easier to use and move from 
build to build.

To add only some packages, specify their name after the above command 
as in:

% ./solaris.py -w $BUILD_IMAGE my_import SUNWcsd ...

----------

Note that the Makefile targets are setup to build specific 
builds.

make 74/import
make 75a/import

will place those builds in the default repo (localhost:10000).

make import doesn't do anything sensible anymore; you must specify
the build as shown.

Some explanantion of solaris.py's arguments would appear useful:

solaris.py [-dn] -b defaultbranch [-B perpkgbranches] [-D elided-file]
  [-w additional_pkg_search_path] [-I includefile] [-j pkg_to_process] 
  [-v defaultversion]  -s repo file1 ...


  -d   		     enable debug messages

  -n   		     fake publication to speed debugging

  -b branch	     specify default branch version for pkgs

  -j pkgname   	     if specified, don't publish all pkgs, just
     		     those named in -j arguments.  Other pkgs are
		     still pre-processed and used to satisfy dependencies.


  -v version	     specify default version for pkgs


  -w path	     specify this directory as part of svr4 pkg
     		     search path. May be used multiple times.

  -B filename	     specify filename that contains lines of  the form

     		     pkgname branch 
               
		     to permit per pkg branch assignments
		     May be used multiple times.

  -D elidedfile	     ignore this file if found in svr4 pkg
		     May be used multiple times.
     
  -I path	     add this directory to default search path
     		     for files included during pkg processing
		     May be used multiple times.

  -T pattern	     Any file basenames matching this pattern will inherit
                     a timestamp attribute from their Svr4 package, and thus
		     will be installed w/ the same timestamp as when they
		     were packaged.  The pattern uses shell-type matching:


		     	  *      matches everything
		     	  ?      matches any single character
		     	  [seq]  matches any character in seq
		     	  [!seq] matches any character not in seq
