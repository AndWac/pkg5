	Chapter 9 - Using SMF to generate side effects, explains how to
	use the Service Management Framework to automatically handle
	any necessary side effects of package installation.

A significant change for package developers between SVR4 packaging and IPS is
how side effects of package installation are handled.  SVR4 packaging used
install-time scripting to perform these modifications which proved to be
problematic for users.  The replacement for part of this functionality is an
interface with SMF services to carry out the needed changes to the system in a
reliable and attributable method.

The package developer must determine which actions, when initially installed or
changed, should cause a side effect to the system.  For each of those actions,
the package developer needs to determine which existing provides the desired
side effect, or write a service which provides the needed functionality.

For example, a package which delivers a new service, the foo service, delivers a
manifest file.  For that service to be available to be used, the manifest-import
service needs to process the newly delivered manifest file.  In this case, the
action delivering the manifest file into lib/svc/manifest or var/svc/manifest
should be tagged with 'restart_fmri=svc:/system/manifest-import:default'.  The
tag ensures that when the manifest is added, updated, or removed, the
manifest-import service is restarted causing the foo service to be added,
updated, or removed.

In addition to restarting a service, it's also possible to refresh a service.
The 'refresh_fmri' tag allows a service to be refreshed after an action has been
installed, updated, or removed.
