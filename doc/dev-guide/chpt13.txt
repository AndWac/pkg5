Solaris and IPS
...............

This chapter describes how Oracle use IPS to package Solaris, and how the
various dependency types are used to define working package sets for Solaris.

XXX Explain our use of incorporations and version-locks

XXX Explain the Solaris versioning scheme (cited in Chapter 4) in particular,
why we went with the very long version strings, eg.
pkg://solaris/entire@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.0.0:20110927T200857Z

XXX Items below taken from from tags-and-attributes.txt, we may need more here

The following attributes are not necessary for correct package installation,
but having a shared convention lowers confusion between publishers and
users.

    info.keyword
       A list of additional terms that should cause this package to be
       returned by a search.

    info.maintainer
       A human readable string describing the entity providing the
       package.  For an individual, this string is expected to be their
       name, or name and email.

    info.maintainer-url
       A URL associated with the entity providing the package.

    info.upstream
       A human readable string describing the entity that creates the
       software.  For an individual, this string is expected to be
       their name, or name and email.

    info.upstream-url
       A URL associated with the entity that creates the
       software delivered within the package.

    info.source-url

        the ARC case or cases associated with the component(s) delivered by
        the package.

    org.opensolaris.smf.fmri

~~~~~~~~~~~~

    variant.opensolaris.zone

Organization specific attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Organizations wishing to provide a package with additional metadata
    or to amend an existing package's metadata (in a repository that
    they have control over) must use an organization-specific prefix.
    For example, a service organization might introduce
    "service.example.com,support-level" or
    "com.example.service,support-level" to describe a level of support
    for a package and its contents.
