2.1.  Repository configuration

2.2.1.  Configuration inheritance

    The pkg.depotd(5) server may need to access repository configuration data when
    smf(5) is unavailable.  As such, a repository must have a cached
    configuration state.

    Roughly, these aspects are sufficient to constrain our configuration
    behavior:

      request properties from svc://application/pkg
      if unavailable, examine configuration cache
      if undefined or unavailable, use hard-coded defaults

2.2.2.  Configuration components

    Repository attributes.  The repository has a collection of simple
    attributes for providing various bits of metadata and configuration
    information.

    repository/  Property group of type "application"
      /name             A short, descriptive name for the repository.

                        Examples:  "opensolaris.org base repository"
                                   "opensolaris.org contrib repository"

      /description      A descriptive paragraph for the repository.

      /icon             A filename of a small image that will be used to
                        visually represent the repository (i.e. web
                        links to the repository, or the icon shown in a
                        user agent's address bar).  This file must be
                        located in the depot server's inst_root
                        directory.

      /logo             A filename of a large image that will be used to
                        visually represent the repository (i.e. on pages
                        generated by the depot serving the repository).
                        This file must be located in the depot's
                        inst_root directory.

      /style            A filename of a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file
                        to use for web content generated by the depot
                        serving the repository.  This file must be
                        located in the depot's inst_root directory.

      /maintainer       A human readable string describing the entity
                        maintaining the repository.  For an individual,
                        this string is expected to be their name, or
                        name and email.

                        Examples:  "Project Indiana"
                                   "Project Indiana <indiana-discuss@
                                   opensolaris.org>"

      /maintainer_url   A URL associated with the entity maintaining the
                        repository.

                        Example:
                        "http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/"

      /detailed_url     One or more URLs to pages or sites with further
                        information about the repository.

                        Example:  "http://www.opensolaris.org/"

    feed/  Property group of type "application"
      /id               A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) used to
                        permanently, uniquely identify the feed.

      /name             A short, descriptive name for RSS/Atom feeds
                        generated by the depot serving the repository.

                        Example:  "opensolaris.org packaging feed"

      /description      A descriptive paragraph for the feed.

      /window           A numeric value representing the number of
                        hours, before the feed for the repository was
                        last generated, to include when creating the
                        for the repository updatelog.  The default value
                        is "24".
