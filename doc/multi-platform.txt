pkg
MULTI-PLATFORM

pkg technology is generic enough to be useful across multiple platforms
(e.g. Windows and Linux).

Below are the issues discovered during a prototyping port effort, to
port pkg to Ubuntu and Windows in August 2007.  
Only basic functionality (e.g. the tests in the
src/tests directory) was tested.

Ubuntu (7.04, a.k.a. "Feisty Fawn")
***********************************

Build support:
--------------
Makefiles don't work with GNU Make
  - Conditional substitution syntax is different

'make install' assumes availability of Solaris tools like pkgmk
  - This depends on the packaging of course, probably should
    have a target to create an IPS package :)
    
Build environment:
------------------
Several Solaris-specific #includes
  - e.g. port.h or sys/systeminfo.h
  - Most have linux counterparts, except for sysinfo(2)
  
Solaris-specific APIs:

  - get_sysinfo(SI_*) (no counterpart on Ubuntu)
  
  - SHA-1 APIs (Solaris has built-in, most Linux use openssl)
  - References to "amd64" (most Linux call this x86_64)
  - Minor differences in libelf constants (e.g. SHT_SUNW_verdef
    vs. SHT_GNU_verdef).
  
Design:
-------

OS Relase version (e.g. uname -r) values contain non-numerics
on Ubuntu (see src/modules/version.py)

Windows XP
