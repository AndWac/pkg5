ELF (AND MAYBE JAR) DEPENDENCY HANDLING

ELF files give us ISA information, required libraries with versions, and
potentially provided interface versions.  This latter information is
missing from a large set of libraries on OpenSolaris, built without
versioned interfaces.

It seems that an ELF file, on upload, can be tested for its ELF
dependencies, and that these files in turn can be tested for presence.
If any of the latter file's revisions provide versions, then these can
be tested and translated into a minimum package requirement for the
package containing the introduced ELF file.

XXX Can we do something similar for JAR files?
