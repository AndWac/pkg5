SUPPORTED ACTIONS

  We need to support an extensible set of "actions", which we define as
  reversible operations that a package can request to enable its later
  function on the target image.

  From the legacy packaging system, we can inspect the class action
  scripts and the postinstall scripts to identify the set of common
  actions.

  [null]	For non editable files
  preserve	Keep edited file, install latest version of file in
  		documented location
  displace	Install file, move edited file to documented location
  service	Package contains service description
  			Inventoried services will be temporarily
			disabled during operations on live images.
  driver	Package contains device driver
  			Module loading will be disabled during
			operations on live images.
  credential	Package requires user, group, or other package-reference
  		managed resource.

  XXX Is this enough to boot?

  XXX Do we have a hard-reboot, reconfigure-reboot, and/or soft-reboot
  action?  Otherwise we are going to build path knowledge somewhere else
  in the packaging system.
