FILTERING

Client presents a filter construct.  Platform, ISA (optional), Diskless
(optional).  (Diskless might be better as a restricted path list.)

Server interprets filter.  May offer challenges to assist in determining
specific version.  Version offerings are constrained by virtue of
inability to change certain paths.
