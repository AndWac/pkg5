IMAGES

Each collection of installed package instances is some kind of image.
We envision three kinds:

- entire images
	An entire image contains (and can contain) all appropriate
	packages from a repository.  It has a machine type and release.

- partial images
	A partial image contains (and can contain) all appropriate
	packages from a repository.  An partial image is tied to an
	entire image and has an identified list of non-writeable
	directory paths.  It inherits its machine type and release.

- user images
	A user image consists entirely of relocatable packages.  It is
	tied to an entire image for dependency satisfaction of
	non-relocatable packages.  It inherits its machine type and
	release.
