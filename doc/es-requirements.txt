ENTERPRISE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

1.  High level requirements.

In no particular order.

- multi-install  Some packages must be able to be installed multiple
times (in separate locations) on the filesystem.

- non-root install

- multi-platform  Includes Windows.

2.  Initial assessment.

Multi-install and non-root install are handled by the user image
type, which allows a per-user install with a separate pkg client cache.
The user image is defined by an image configuration specifying its type,
its root directory, and its parent image (for satisfying non-relocatable
packages).

Not sure how to proceed on the Windows requirement.  Most of the current
design is portable across POSIX/ELF systems.
